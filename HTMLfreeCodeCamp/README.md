# Web Development Projects

This repository contains several web development projects built with **HTML** and **CSS** as part of my learning journey.
Each project is intended to run on a **Live Server**.

## How to Run the Projects Locally

To view any of the projects locally, follow the steps below:

### Requirements
- **Visual Studio Code** (VS Code) with the **Live Server extension** installed.
  - [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
  - [Install Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

### Steps to View Projects:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   - First, clone this repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
     ```
   
2. **Open the project folder**:
   - Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code** by navigating to the cloned folder and running:
     ```bash
     code .
     ```

3. **Start the Live Server**:
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file (or any `.html` file you want to view) and select **"Open with Live Server"** from the context menu.
   - This will open the project in your default web browser, and it will automatically refresh as you make changes to the files.
